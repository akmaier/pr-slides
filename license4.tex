    \textbf{DESCRIPTION AND FORMAT OF DATA}
  \end{center}

  \section*{Description of Data}

  The \emph{FAU Aibo Emotion Corpus} is a corpus of spontaneous, emotionally colored speech of children interacting with the Sony pet robot Aibo.
  51 children at the age of 10 to 13 years have been recorded at two German schools using a close-talk microphone.
  The corpus consists of about 9 hours of German speech.
  The audio recordings of the children have been segmented manually into small, syntactically meaningful 'chunks' using syntactic-prosodic criteria.
  Each chunk is stored in a separate audio file.
  The data has been annotated with 11 emotion-related categories by five human labelers on the word level.
  The categories are:   

  \begin{table}[!h]
    \small
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l p{10cm}}
      \toprule
      label & user state & description \\
      \midrule
      J & joyful        & the child enjoys Aibo's action and/or notices that something is funny\\
      S & surprised     & the child is (positively) surprised, because obviously he or she did not expect Aibo to react that way\\
      M & motherese     & the child addresses Aibo in the way mothers/parents address their babies (also called 'infant-directed speech') -- either because Aibo is well-behaving or because the child wants Aibo to obey; this is the positive equivalent to 'reprimanding'\\
      N & neutral       & default user state, not belonging to any other category; not labeled explicitly\\
      O & other         & not neutral but not belonging to any of the other categories, i.\,e.\ some other spurious emotions\\
      B & bored         & the child is (momentarily) not interested in the interaction with Aibo\\
      E & emphatic      & the child speaks in a pronounced, accentuated, sometimes hyper-articulated way but without showing any emotion\\
      H & helpless      & the child hesitates, seems not to know what to tell Aibo next; can be marked by disfluencies and/or filled pauses\\
      T & touchy        & the child is slightly irritated; pre-stage of anger\\
      R & reprimanding  & the child is reproachful, reprimanding, 'wags the finger'; this is the negative equivalent of 'motherese'\\
      A & angry         & the child is clearly angry, annoyed, speaks in a loud voice\\
%      X & the word is not labeled 
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
  \end{table}

  FAU provides the original emotion labels of the five human labelers on the word level as well as one derived emotion label for the whole chunk.
  Furthermore, the transliteration of the audio data with the corresponding lexicon, and information about the gender and the age of the children are provided.


  \section*{Data Format}

  The data will be released in the following format:

  FAU provides a download link for an ISO image.
  The audio files are stored in the Waveform Audio File Format (WAVE) using linear pulse-code modulation, mono, 16\,bit, and a sampling frequency of 16\,kHz.
  The annotations, transcriptions, and meta data will be provided as plain-text files.
