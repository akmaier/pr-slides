Several quality-of-life fixes applied to the last official LME LaTeX Beamer Template done by T. Geimer

**Macros**

*Partner Logo*

Space for an additional partner logo in the header positioned next to the LME Logo:

```
\setPartnerLogo{"PartnerLogoPath"}
```

*Conference / Group Seal*

Additional Seal (e.g. for conference logo) on the title page at a mirrored position to the FAU Seal.

```
\setLeftSeal{"SealPath"}
```
